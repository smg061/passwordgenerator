## Password generator

This page allows the user to generate a random password of their chosen length. The app can be accessed from [here](http://smg061.github.io/passwordgenerator)


## Features

### Password length
After pressing the 'Generate Password' button, the user is prompted to enter the desired length (must be greater than 8)

### Character Set selection
This app allows the user to select the types of characters to be used for the random password. The user can select to include lower, upper, numeric, and special characters

### Input validation 
Crashes and unwanted expections are handled through multiple layers of input validation and alert messages. For example, if the user inputs a number < 8 as the password length, doesn't input anything, or they input something that is not a number, the app handles this and alerts the user. Likewise, if the user does not select any character sets to generate a password, the program will alert the user and terminate.
